/* # A very common website feature

The goal of this exercise is to recreate a section that is found on many informational websites.

For this one you will need to edit the HTML a little bit too. We can't be making things _too_ easy for you. You'll want to add containers around the various elements so that you can flex them. Good luck!

## Desired outcome

### Self Check

- All items are centered on the page (horizontally, not vertically).
- The title is centered on the page.
- There is 32px between the title and the 'items.'
- There is 52px between each item.
- The items are arranged horizontally on the page.
- The items are only 200px wide and the text wraps.  
- The item text is centered. */


/* 1.do not overdo flexbox
2.to make the title centered,text-align is enough
3.when to use gap or margin:"There is 32px between the title and the 'items.'"
4."The items are only 200px wide and the text wraps".In this case max-width should be set on items */
